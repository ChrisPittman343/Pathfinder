## Shortest Path Visualizer
### (Dijkstra's + A*)
Make some walls and choose which algorithm you'd like to visualize! (Must refresh page/ clear board in between uses)

When creating walls, you have the option to choose how much "weight" each node has. By default, it is set to Infinity (impassable wall), but it can go from 2-8 by dragging the slider.
